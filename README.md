# Atri Labs at conferences

At Atri Labs, we regularly speak at international conferences and local meetups to share our experiences of building [Atri framework](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine). The topics we cover include deep dive into React and the surrounding web development ecosystem, tutorials on how to use Atri framework, etc.

Below is a list of those conferences in chronological order. You can visit the README of each conference to learn about our talk, view presentation materials and watch the talk recording (if available).
